# Configuration Management 101 - writing puppet manifests

## Description:

We learn about server configuration management (also referred to as IT Automation) to turn any infrastructure administration into a codebase, describing all processes necessary for deploying a server in a set of provisioning scripts that can be versioned and easily reused.

It can greatly improve the integrity of any server infrastructure over time.

We study the process of automating server provisioning using Puppet, a popular configuration management tool capable of managing complex infrastructure in a transparent way, using a master server to orchestrate the configuration of the nodes.
