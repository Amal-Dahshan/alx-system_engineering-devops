# Incident Report: Web Stack Debugging Outage

### Issue Summary:
On March 3rd, our web stack experienced a significant outage that resulted in downtime for 12 hrs. Users were unable to access the website and services during this time, leading to a negative impact on user experience and potential revenue loss.

### Timeline:
- [8:00pm]: Users began reporting issues with accessing the website.
- [8:15pm]: The engineering team was alerted to the outage and began investigating.
- [12:00am]: Initial attempts to resolve the issue were unsuccessful.
- [5:00am]: The root cause of the outage was identified.
- [8:00am]: A resolution was implemented, restoring service to users.

### Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was determined to be a misconfiguration in the web server settings. This misconfiguration led to a bottleneck in processing incoming requests, causing the server to become overwhelmed and unresponsive. Additionally, there were issues with caching mechanisms that further exacerbated the problem.

### Resolution:
To resolve the issue, the engineering team reconfigured the web server settings to optimize performance and increase capacity for handling incoming requests. They also implemented fixes for the caching mechanisms to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. After these changes were made, service was restored and users were able to access the website once again.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar outages from occurring in the future, several corrective and preventative measures have been put in place:
1. Regular monitoring of web server performance metrics to identify potential bottlenecks or issues before they impact users.
2. Implementing automated testing procedures to catch misconfigurations or other issues before they go live.
3. Conducting regular audits of caching mechanisms and other critical components of the web stack to ensure they are functioning as intended.
4. Developing a comprehensive incident response plan that outlines steps for quickly identifying and resolving outages when they occur.

By implementing these measures, we aim to minimize downtime and ensure a seamless user experience on our platform moving forward.

This incident report serves as a learning opportunity for our team, highlighting areas for improvement in our web stack configuration and monitoring processes. We are committed to continuously improving our systems and processes to provide reliable service for our users.
